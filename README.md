## About

The advancements in technology are growing exponentially, increasing the waste of still functional devices. In a future that has taken this to an extreme, what would happen if those machines started developing feelings? We have a two player co-op multi-level puzzle game featuring a layered story, unique set of mechanics, clever puzzles and Lego-like art style. Just like Wall-E, live the story of a friendship from the screen of your PC.

*PREPARE FOR A PUZZLING ESCAPE!*
